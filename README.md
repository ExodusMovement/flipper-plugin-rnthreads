# flipper-plugin-reanimated

This is a plugin for the [Flipper](https://github.com/facebook/flipper) debugging tool, which allows for debugging React Native apps using the Reanimated package.
It is mainly based on the hermesdebuggerrn plugin that is bundled with Flipper, but with a few minor changes that are needed for our use-case.
